## Chapter 1

### 1.1 What is a distributed system?

**"A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements
that appears to its users as a single coherent system."**

#### Characteristic 1: Collection of autonomous computing elements

A fundamental principle is that nodes can act independently from each other.
(global clock/synchronization/coordination/group membership/open group/closed group)
overlay network (Structured overlay/Unstructured overlay)

#### Characteristic 2: Single coherent system
distribution transparency

#### Middleware and distributed systems
To assist the development of distributed applications, distributed systems are
often organized to have a separate layer of software that is logically placed on
top of the respective operating systems of the computers that are part of the
system.

The distributed system provides the means for components of a single distributed application to communicate with each
other, but also to let different applications communicate. At the same time, it hides, as best and reasonably as possible, the differences in hardware and
operating systems from each application.</br>
In a sense, middleware is the same to a distributed system as what an operating system is to a computer: a manager of resources offering its applications
to efficiently share and deploy those resources across a network.
Next to resource management, it offers services that can also be found in most operating systems, including:
* Facilities for interapplication communication.
* Security services.
* Accounting services.
* Masking of and recovery from failures.</br>
Typical  middleware services:
* Communication - Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
* Transactions
* Service composition
* Reliability

### 1.2 Design goals
* make resources easily accessible
* hide the fact that resources are distributed across a network
* it should be open
* it should be scalable

#### Supporting resource sharing
make it easy for users to access and share remote resources. (collaborate and exchange information)</br>
file-sharing peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent.
#### Making distribution transparent
hide the fact that its processes and resources are physically distributed across multiple computers possibly separated by large distances.</br>

#### Being open
An open distributed system is essentially a system that offers components that can easily be used by, or integrated into other systems.
##### Interoperability, composability, and extensibility
To be open means that components should adhere to standard rules that describe the **syntax** and **semantics** of what those components have to offer.
A general approach is to define services through **interfaces** using an **Interface Definition Language (IDL)**.
Interface definitions written in an IDL nearly always capture only the syntax of services(function names,type of parameters,return values).
The hard part is specifying precisely what those services do (specifications), that is, the semantics of interfaces.</br>

Proper specifications are **complete** and **neutral**.Complete means that everything that is necessary to make an implementation has indeed been specified.
Just as important is the fact that specifications do not prescribe what an implementation should look like; they should be neutral.</br>

**Completeness** and **neutrality** are important for **interoperability** and **portability**.
Interoperability characterizes the extent by which two implementations of systems or components from different manufacturers can co-exist and work together by merely relying
on each otherâ€™s services as specified by a common standard. Portability characterizes to what extent an application developed for a distributed system A can be executed, 
without modification, on a different distributed system B that implements the same interfaces as A. Also, it should be easy to add new components or
replace existing ones without affecting those components that stay in place **extensible**.

#### Being Scalable
Scalability dimensions:
* **Size scalability**: A system can be scalable with respect to its size, meaning that we can easily add more users and resources to the system without  any noticeable loss of performance.
* **Geographical scalability**: is one in which the users and resources may lie far apart, but the fact that communication delays may be significant is hardly noticed
* **Administrative scalability**: is one that can still be managed even if it spans many independent administrative organizations.
